<p>Woman, Ego, Shadow Ladan Osman
Now I go into a brown sleep,
and look for Myself.
The last time I tried to see her,
I dreamed of a white cricket.
Its chirp was deafening.
It survived the fire and disappeared.
Who has taken Myself?
When she was with me, Dream was a mug
with a chipped rim, concrete against the lip,
sand in the teeth.
We never swallowed the missing pieces.
Myself was firmly affixed on a path.
She drank boiling tea with Destiny
and said, girl, girl, how come
I got so much middle luck?
Me and Myself are two flames,
following a line of gunpowder.
We race, combine, then extinguish.
Me and Myself are a tree’s ashen roots
and the sidewalk that boxes them in.
Me and Myself are a dial tone ringing out into the street.
Me and Myself are a small house, poor but not mean.
She is the tall window that shows a bed and an open wardrobe.
I am the young man considering T-shirts and jerseys.
She is the woman who looks up at him from the street.
I am the rat that runs eager in the yard.
Me and Myself have been raping each other
for a long time. Myself prefers a boot on the back of the neck
so all the neighbors can see her try to make Me pray to
    the pavement.
Where has she packed her purse and gone off to this time?
She could never tell if she would take the train north or south
until she frowned and let it pass
or sat by the window.
Myself used to hear everything wrong. She’d say,
them Gulf Coast men was bullied and harnessed by their bosses.
But then, the wrong music was better if it whistled from her.
She’d say, the wolves been biting just to taste.
Or, the caterpillars are denuding their homes. A tree’s privates
are the loneliest place.
Myself burned her palm into my back.
When I turn to see if she’s there, she goes.
I am looking for Myself!
If you fall asleep on the couch and see her,
tell her I have a knife
for the place between her shoulder blades.
Tell her I said, you lie so good, you make the ocean sweet.
Tell her I said, something’s standing by my bedside and I know it
    ain’t her.
Tell her my sleep is usually navy blue or even greening gold
and I want it browner than knees or butt cheeks.
Tell her something that tastes like tea with grit in it.
Tell her I put poison in the pot and intend to watch her drink it
    while telling me
something
crazy. Tell her I’m out of breath.
Tell her there’s a paw the weight of a large stone on my chest.
Tell her I’ve seen the moon come red out of blackness.
Tell her the sand is rising as one people and rushing somewhere.
Tell her she’s missing all my wildness and if she doesn’t come
    on soon,
I’ll have to go looking for My Shadow, and Myself knows
Shadow’s the kind who don’t take her shoes off
for Nobody.
